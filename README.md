Life
====
A simulation of Conway's Game of Life. <br>
This was written in my 2nd year at university as an assignment on parallelism and concurrency. <br>

I didn't bother to include a makefile because there are only 3 sourcefiles.<br>
Just run "javac GameOfLife.java GameOfLifeSequential.java GameWindow.java" to compile.<br>
Run "java GameofLife" or "java GameofLifeSequential" depending on the mode you want.
